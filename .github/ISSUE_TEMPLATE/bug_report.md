**Prerequisites**

Before submitting a bug report, please ensure you have followed these steps:

1. **Browser Verification:**
   - Check if the issue occurs in a different browser.
   - Alternatively, try to reproduce the issue in incognito mode (this helps rule out cache-related issues).

2. **Sidebar Test:**
   - Remove additional nodes by doing the following:
     - Navigate to the `custom_nodes` folder.
     - Cut all nodes and paste them into a temporary folder outside of `custom_nodes`, except for `ComfyUI-N-Sidebar` and, if present, `ComfyUI-Manager`**.
   - Launch ComfyUI and test if the problem persists.
   
** you can restore the original situation by moving back the nodes from the temporary folder to the `custom_nodes` folder and restarting  ComfyUI.

3. **Identify Node Conflicts:**
   - If the problem is resolved, it is likely caused by a conflict with one of the removed nodes.
   - Try to identify the conflicting node: maybe it was added recently if the problem did not exist before.
   - If you find the conflicting node, please open an issue to inform me so I can attempt to resolve the problem (if possible).
